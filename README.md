# gestational_age_approximation
Algorithm for approximating the gestational age (countinuous - weeks) and preterm category (0 -False, 1 -True) based on self reported reported mestrual period (LMP) and ultrasound data (FC_SCAN, FC_SCAN_DATE.) The aglorithm checks for cutoff preiods at each trimester to determine whether the ultrasound or lmp is used in generating the final outcome variable.
