# Gestational Age Approximation 
Algorithm for approximating the gestational age (countinuous - weeks) and preterm category (0 -False, 1 -True) based on self reported reported mestrual period (LMP) and ultrasound data (FC_SCAN, FC_SCAN_DATE.) The aglorithm checks for cutoff preiods at each trimester to determine whether the ultrasound or lmp is used in generating the final outcome variable.

Each step is seperated in a markdown document with subsequent participant checks to keep track of exclusion/inclusion criteria that is accounted for at the end.
